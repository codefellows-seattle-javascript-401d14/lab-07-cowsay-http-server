* This project allowed us to use cowsay in order to have fun with the createServer method,
which allowed us to make use of the POST/GET features in order to learn more about HTTP servers.
* In order to use this you can port into our localhost:3000 and using httpie command such as ~http GET
localhost:3000 text=='hahah'~ for POST use ~http POST localhost:3000 text='haha'~
